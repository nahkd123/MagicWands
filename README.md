# MagicWands #
## What the HELL is this? ##
This is Slimefun addon, that's adds magic wands to your server. These wands can be programmable by using wands programmer.

## Sound epic, how do I install this? ##
First, you'll need these plugins:
- Slimefun 4 (ofc because this is Slimefun Addon)
- CS-Core Lib

If you're asking "wait wait should I use stable builds or development builds?", then please use the development build. I know,
it's not stable to use, but meh, idc...

## I want you to add abcxyzjdsakla to this addon ##
Please create a new issue on Issues tab, I'll review it and do stuffs with it.
